# hw5-day-planner

## Task 
    The Task for this assignment was to make a day planner the dynamically update as the day goes on. The Time blocks need to change color based on the time, it should have three colors one for past, present and future. lastly the reminder should save to local stroage so that each time they load the page it populates. 


## The Project
    For this project I used Jquery to select and dynamically generate the day planner which has a structure similar to a list. The planner is made up of the Time Block section, reminder section, and lastly the save button. The Time block shows the time of day in which the reminder is for, the reminder is where the reminder will be typed and saved when the save button is clicked. The save function is a work in progress right now, I will hopefully figure it out soon.
    
    This project could be used by someone to keep track of things the have schduled for the day during work hours. This is a simple project that has a lot of limitation on what it can actully be used for.
